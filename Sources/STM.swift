/// A monad supporting atomic memory transactions.
///
/// `STM` is the interface to the atomic memory transaction manager and subsumes
/// the use of fine-grained locking for shared mutable memory entirely.  This
/// implementation guarantees consistency with respect to the effects of all
/// executing transactions, atomicity with respect to each individual operation,
/// and isolation of effects down to each subpart of a transaction.  `STM` is 
/// also exception-safe.  Any transactions that throw exceptions will be rolled 
/// back and their effects elided.
///
/// The main use for `STM` is interacting with transactional variables 
/// (`TVar`s).  By design, this is because the type system prevents you reading 
/// or writing a `TVar` outside an atomic `STM` block.
///
/// `STM` also exposes operations to allow blocking and choice, `retry()` and
/// `orElse` respectively.
///
/// Note that it is possible to deadlock under this scheme if a transaction
/// `retry()`s without another transaction mutating its memory.  It is also
/// highly discouraged that side effects be executed inside of transactions.  It
/// makes a transaction fundamentally non-atomic to do so, and the results of
/// committing such a transaction are undefined.
///
/// `STM` actions can be composed together with `flatMap` or `then`.
///
/// *"The free lunch is over."*

	///
	/// - Atomicity: the effects of an atomic act become visible to another
	///   thread all at once.
	/// - Isolation: during the call, the action is completely unaffected by 
	///   other threads.  It is as if the action takes a snapshot of the state 
	///   of the world when it begins running, and then executes against that
