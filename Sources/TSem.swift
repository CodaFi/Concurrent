/// `TSem is a transactional semaphore. It holds a certain number of units, and 
/// units may be acquired or released by `wait()` and `signal()` respectively. 
/// When the TSem is empty, `wait()` blocks.
///
/// Note that `TSem` has no concept of fairness, and there is no guarantee that
/// threads blocked in `wait()` will be unblocked in the same order; in fact 
/// they will all be unblocked at the same time and will fight over the TSem. 
/// Hence TSem is not suitable if you expect there to be a high number of 
/// threads contending for the resource. However, like other STM abstractions, 
/// TSem is composable.
